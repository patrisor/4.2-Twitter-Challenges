# Overkill Hangman
This is a hangman engine built for the command-line on a macOS 10.13.4 (Kernel Version: Darwin 17.5.0) which parses any file of words, delimited by a '\n'. The vanilla version parses 370103 words. Feel free to play with it, hack it, whatever you want. I made sure to comment every function so please use it to your educational advantage. 

## How to use
* `git clone https://github.com/patrisor/4.2-Twitter-Challenges.git`
